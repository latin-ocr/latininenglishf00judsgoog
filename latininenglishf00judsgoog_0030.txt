3. What the Romans called the quantity of atovel is un-
known in English. We distinguish between different sounds ol
the same vowel, us ola in hate, hot, sother, all. But we pay
no attention to the relative time it takes to make these various
sounds.

The Romans, however, gave one, and only oue, sound to
any vowel. The Latin a, ior instance, had always the sound
' oi the English a in ‚tothm But this one sound oi a vowel
they made in two ways: either protracting it, thus making it
lony, 0r clipping it off, thus making it short This distinction
as to the length oi time taken in sounding avowel they called
quantity.

The quantityof a vowel, then, is the relative time taken in
sounding it. ’

With reference to quantity, vowels are either long or short
A long vowel should take twice the time oi a short vowel.

In printing, quantity is indicated· hy a mark over the vowel,
ey. long a is printed a, and short a, d. A vowel which may be
either long or short is called common, and has both marks 3
ay. k.

4. The remaining letters of the alphabet are conso
nants (consonantes, souadinp arith).

Their eounds can be made only utta vowel sounds.

The consonante in Latin have the same sound as in
English, with the following exceptions:

c and g are always hard (te. ο as in cot, g as in yos).

i has the sound of y, and v nearly that of w.

sis always sharp (as in sota· never like s in windam).

b before s has the sound of p.

n has the sound of ds (or perhaps of sd).

n is not really a Latin letter. The Romans horrowed it from
Greek.

of the verb is usually retained; as ornare, emimen-
tsrm (p. 149). The stem vowel e or i is often changed
before the suffix for convenience of articulation.

Thus, from docere, documentum emoliresemolrt·

4. Some verb sterns have two forms: demere
(detra), <lenimentum discernere (uncti), moenem

lucere (lr'r), lumen3 pingere (pig-l, pigmentum (p 149) ;
- torquere (ton), tormentum 3 movere (mo), momentum

5. The final consonant of a nude stem is often
assimilated (122) before a consonant following: secare,
segmentum. .

6. Sometimes a derivative is formed from the stem
of a noun, just es if there were a verb with that stem:
tllbemel-7 tabemaculum3 littera, litteratura.

7. English words are formed directly from the stems
of nearly all of these Latin derivative nouns.

1) Very often the English merely uses the Latin
nude stem. Sometimes a short vowel in the penult
of the stem is cut out, and often the English word
is spelled with a final silent e. Thus we have circle
from circulo, ylobcle from globulo, scrrrple from seru.
puld, copsnle from capsnlo'f, appetite from appetite,
oblielon from obfirmo, ordor from ardor, argument
from argfimento, receptocle from receptaculo, operuere
from apertae.

2) When the nude stem ends in 1, this is usually
spelled y in English. Thus we have notory from
notant, coiory from ariano, follocy from fallacie.
From calendario, however, we have calendar, instead

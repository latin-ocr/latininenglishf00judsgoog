or a preposition in an adverbial sense), while the
second part is the stem of an inflected word ’

122. When the stems of inflected words are put
together, there are apt to be some phonetic changes:
magne † anlmb 1- e = magnanimus, great-souled. The
stem vowel 6 in the first part is lost before a vowel:
sgxo†cbls=sgrxoola, a former. The stem vowel ὅ
becomes 1.

We saw in tubicen that the stem of the first part
was tuba, the a being changed to 1. This is every
common change in forming compounds.¹ And 1 is even
added to a consonant stem: pio, peuce,'†ssc, mulce,
= pacificus, peucemolcinq.

Also in tubicen we see that the root vowel a in the
second part becomes ὅ. This also is common—a or
ὅ becomiug 1, ae (as infxitrlcida) hemmingi, au be-
coming δ or ιῑ. ἂ sometimes becomes ὅ or 11.

'l'he first part of a compound word is often a par-
ticle (101). But many particles end in a consonant.
And if the second part of the compound begins with
a consonant, there is usually a phonetic change. Thus,
ln, against, † pugnare, to fiybl, = impugnare, to fiylrt
0901001. Here the lingual n becomes the correspond-
ing labial m (5) before the labial ⁶p (by pronouncing
inpugnare and impugnare the student will see how
much easier the latter is). ll'his change is called poa·-
liul assimilatione.

An example of complete ossimdullon is infuere, to
louyb ot, compounded of ln -l- ridere. In this word n
is changed to the same letter as that following.

tuns, thy; suns, bis, bero, its, moira· uomet, me ; vester,
your. They are all infleoted as ο and a stem adjeo-
tives: melis, metim, me53 noster, nostrum, noet153
vester, vestium, vestre. Tuus and suits are inflected
like melis.

The genitives of the persona] pronouns are not used
to denote possession. The possessive pronouns take
their place in that meaning.

3. The demo'nstrative pronouns are hic, this; ille,
thou· 1s‚thot; iste, thot.

Of the last three, all translated thot, 11Ιό is emphatic, and
iste often implies contempt. Iste often is used to refer to

something belonging to the person addressed‚ and so is called
tho demonstrative of the second person.

The inflection of all these words shows some quite
old forms. They are all used as adjectives‚ and are

infleoted in both numbers and all genders. ,

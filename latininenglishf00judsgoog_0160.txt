stem 1101611111, the perfect stem nemmem, and the
supine stem meminit».

It at once appears that the stem nemm· is formed
from the root· no by adding the suffix min-3 the various
stems 01 nosce by attaching to the same root (which
is the same as the verb stem) the suffixos ee, -v-, and
-t; and the stem 01 nebssis hy attaching to no the
suffix -bss1·. All these stema then, are formed directly
from the root.

But the verb stem 116111111- is evidently formed
from the noun stem nemm- by attaching the vowel i.

Stems, then, we infer, arc formed directly from roots ·

or directly from other stems, in each case by attaching
suffixes.

Stems formed directly from roots, like nemin, are
called 1111111111 srnms. Stems formed from other
stema, like remma, are c'alled snconnnrr smms

110. Let us look at a few other nouns: praendmen,
first acme (literally, fore name); cogndmen, lost acrae
(literally, with name) ; agndmdm added adme. ι

We see that all 01 these have the same stem,
nemin, but differ in the prefix.

We see also that these prefixes are all prepositions:
prae, before ,· 00 (= edm), 101111 (the g in cognemen we
should find on careful study to be a part of the older
form 01 the stem -gnfimln-‚ from the older form of the
root, gno-); ed· (123), 10 (tc. a name attached to a
name: an added name).

Prepesitions, with some sort 01 adverbial sense,
usually, ars commonly used as prefixes.

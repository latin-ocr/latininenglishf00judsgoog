οἱ criemenges if making a second nude stem by
dropping i. Concordia formed in the same way from
concordie. Usary, from usura, is formed as ii from
astem inte.

3) A nude stem ending in -tl- has a different change

in English. ·t› becomes c. l is sometimes written y,
as in clcrneacy, from clementiis, but is usually dropped,

a silent e being written after the c (thus giving c the ³

sound oi s), asin oseriae, from avaritia.

This occurs because these words come to us through the
French. But French originally was only a sort of colloquial
Latin, such as was spoken by people who could neither read
nor write. Ol course, then, they made many changes in their
ways cl pronouncing Latin words. And among these changes
was the slipping in oi an secund aiter t in final syllables oi
stems: thus, the Latin nude stem clementi, oi elementia,
merciselness, became clementer. But t before s is not easy
to pronounce‚ and soon dropped away, leaving the word cle·
mensi (spelled in French clemencie). We use this Erench
word, spelling it clemente (y being the customary English
equivalent of French ie -as in Mare, lor the French Maria).

4) Stems in aar, when used as an English word, ι

lost the final t, y being written instead of a Thus we
have affierity, from affinitas.

This change is also due to the Breuem—the Latin stem
amnicae becuming the French afficite, which we use with the
spelling afficite.

5) Stems in -tndin- also lose the last two letters in
English, silent e being written at the end. Thus we
have lassitudo from lassrtfidin, latitede from latudine.¹
The former is really the nominative form laseltdde
treated as a stem (see 134).

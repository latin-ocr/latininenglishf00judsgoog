2. Another change consists in dropping out ⁷1 (and

sometimes ὅ or n) in a suffix between a mute and a
liquid. The nude stem of amicabilis, friendly (stem
amicabili), is amicabile We drop out1 between b and
1, and write the stem omieable-adding the silente.

3. When the nude stem ends inadoubled consonant,
we usually drop one, unless the necent falls on the
final syllable. Thus deterrere, to silphion froin gives
deter, instead of ἀείρω but we write add, null, still.

4. If the nude stem ends in t, it is written y in
English. Pulmonin'nn belonging to tlte lange, gives
pulmonem, instead of pulmonari; lapididus, o stone
entier, gives lapidem aviarium, a place to keep birds
(117, 5), gives aetery. But sometimes 1 is dropped

instead oi being written as p: capitol, from capitolium

We also use ty instead of final tit in nude stems
of nouns: revicit (N. levicias), ltpbtness, we write
leoity.

perhaps originally from mere carelessness.

The first word in the Latin version of the ereed
which is reeited in the churoh services is oredo, I
believe. The nude stem is oren, which we should
expect to find written crede. At an early period it
was written in that way, the silent e at the end show·
ing that the other e was long. But somehow we have
come to indicate that long sound by doubling the e,
writing ereed instead of crede. ¹

Bon, the name of a shmb, or tree, comes from buxa.
Fama is from fismt3 forle from furca.

The nude stem disc, from ducis, n platter, n plote,

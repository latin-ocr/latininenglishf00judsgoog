84. Verb stems ending in a short vowel (e, a) form
stems, and are inflected in general like stems in a long
vowel.

A short vowel, however, is so easily lost or changed,
that some apparent differenees occur.

In the perfect stem the vowel is lost, and the stem suffixv
becomes n.

Verb stem mone, perfect stem monii· (for monem)
“ eona, “ sonii- (somonam)v

In the supine stem the short vowel becomes 1.

’ Verb stem mone, supine stein moult· (for moneo)
“ sona, “ const· (somenae)

The inflection of stems in ὅ and a is like that of
stems in ὃ and ξ.

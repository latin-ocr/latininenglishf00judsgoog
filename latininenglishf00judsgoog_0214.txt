been explained, this was the form which world be
incessantly heard in conversation, and so it would be
natural to use this and to drop off the suffixes of infleo
tion which were peculiar to the Latin grammar.

Thus the nude stem of arce, n cheat, is aro, which
we write crin· celle gives us cell, columne, column.

verbnm (stem verbe), word, gives us verb (to. the
word, the most important word, in a sentence).

In like manner corne nenton (from acorion, increns-
tny), benefactor (from benefactor, well doec), font (from
font, N. fons, n sonntoin). The adjectivae augustns
and aquaticus give us nrrqnat and aqnntr'e. From ah
accudere, ιο ln‘dc away, comes wacond, and advertere,
ιο torn ιο, gives us adcon.

142. In writing these stems as English words we
sometimes make slight changes in spelling. For in-
stance, the nude stem of arce, n elective write art,
which is conveniently different from the nude stem of
archs, n bon, which we write nro.

stem of a silent e. Thus we write recline, from recli-
nere, ιο leon bock,· probe, from probare, ιο prooe; cede,
from cedere, ιο pietat· captive, from captivus, ο prisoner ;
convince, from convincere, ιο oonqnen This e is not
sounded, and its use is to show that the next preceding
vowel is long (probe, not prob), or that a preceding
c or 9 should have the soft sound (convince, we pro
nounce connino, not mnatrrk). It is also added when
the word otherwise would end in a mute and a liquid '
-onnatta

(te. the stem without its vowel). A slight change in
spelling the final syllable is comm0n; ap. the nude
stem of copiosas, full cf abundavere, is copisa, which
in English becomes capreas. methca, fall cf words,

we spell verbosa The latter seems the more natural ,

way of spelling the word, as the final e is so com-
monly used in English, especially when we wish to
show that the preceding vowel has not its short sonnd3

ap. bat, hate. But the suffix cas, used instead cf osc, .

is explained by the fact that the words in which it
occurs come to us not directly from the Latin, but
from a French word which itself was derived from
the Latin. The words in oce, on the other hand, come
directly from the Latin. Inthis way we see at once
the history cf such words as generent, jocose, pervii
cicae, edicas.

2. When the nude stem ends in two consonante we
do not need to change the spelling. Thus we have
just, pastilam, fraudabat (see the endings).

3. The Latin suffix -bss1-‚ when made nude, becomes
-bss·. We do not prcnounce the 1, and so have dropped
it out, a silent c being added. Hence we have affecte,
teniblc, and the like.

GREEK ΛΝΒ LA TIN.

while the book is intended primarily for those who without it would
never study Greek at all, those have also been kept in mind who will
afterwards continue the study. Yet with the possible exception of the
dual number, the memorizing of which is but a trifle, no feature what-
ever has been introduced which could involve labor outside of the main
purpose, as set forth above.

ΑΝ lNTRODUCTlON TO ATTlC GREEK. By Jnnrz

Bnooxs, Professor in the University of Minnesota 12m0.

Presents essentials in such manner that the leamer may enter without
geedless detention upon an intelligent and successful reading of Attic

reek.

The fundamental idea-that uine years' experience in applying has
shown to be practicable-is to begin the study of Greek with a con-
nected text, and to so work this text over as to derive from it all the
grammar involved, and then to attach to the framework thus formed
whatever further grammatical apparatus is necessary. ln this way the

' learner's activities are incited to discover for himself the laws of con·

struction, and the author studied is made to appear as their true source.

The first chapter of the Anabasis has been found to contain a stock
of words sufficiently varied to illustrate all the essential forms of the
accidence, and isaccordingly taken as a basis for work.

Conversation and dictation exercises, appealing to the leamer’s powers
of imitation, form an integral part of the plan, and, it has been found,
give him a natural and unconscious grip o the languageexceeding that
obtained by any other exercise.

GREEK LlTERATURE. By Thonis Snncnrvr Pannv.

8v0.

A compendious philosophical account of the growth of Greek litera·
ture and of its relations to the physieal surroundings and political and
social history of the people. In this setting appear the outliues of the
great masterpieces, with English translations of their more interesting
or representative passages. The comparative method is followed, the
English reader’s familiarity with his own literature being made to help
along his acquaintance with Greek authors. lt is believed that the
college-bred man who got from his study of these classics in the origi-
nal but faint and distorted views of their beauties will here find assist-
ance in extending and organizing his knowledge ς and also that the man
who knows little or no Greek may by this book put himself in closer
contact with the spirit of Greek literature than most students of the
language have attained.

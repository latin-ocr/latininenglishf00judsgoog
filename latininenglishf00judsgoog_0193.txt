rec] ronunrrow or couronwo wonns. 167

If we look at another compound Latin verb, accl-
pere, to receive, we see that the English derivative is '
occepi (145, bc). Here plainly the supine stem, in-
stead of the nude present stem, is taken, hut with
exaetly the same meaning. Notice circumvent, exon
erute, inceniprote, oppress (from opprimere), prohibit,
substitute, trorcsprcss. ¹

§anstigno (stem saxifrbgd), sione crusbinp, is eon-
verted into the English swifrope, by using the nude
stem with finale silent. The saxifrage is a delicate
plant which derives its name, as some say, because it
grows in creviees of the rocks; more probably because
it was onec thought that if taken as a medicine it
would break up a stone in the bladder.

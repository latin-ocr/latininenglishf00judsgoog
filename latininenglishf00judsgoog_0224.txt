The Latin perfect-participle was regularly used by the
Romans as an adieetive. In this sense the nude stem oi the
participle, which is the same as the supine stem, was originally
horrowed by the English. For instance, the supine stem of
creare, ιο create, is creat. And in an English poem oi the
fourteenth century we find the author (Chaucer) seying ‘⁴ God
Ιιοιιι creat all things,” which is evidently equivalent to “heth
created” But in order to be sure that there could be no mis-
take about the meaning, people began to attach our past parti-
ciple suffix -ed to the Latin stem, thus making created. And as
that at once suggested averb create, it was not long rmtil that

came to be used. Also, see Skeat's Etymologicel Dietionary, ,

under abbreviata. But these supine stems vve sometimes use
as adjectives: defunct, οονιοοι, object.

2. The present stem of many Latin verbs is also
used as an English word, usually a verb. Thus from
eadere, ιο yield, we have cede.

3. The stem oi the present participle is sometimes
used as an English adjective or noun. Thus from
agere, ιο cio, we have agent, ie. one who cloes something 3
and from sssrssire, ιο hias, eomes sibilaut, ie. hissieg.

4. The Latin perfect stem is not used as an English ³

word.
t. The most of our words taken from Latin verb
stems come from consonant stema or a stema.

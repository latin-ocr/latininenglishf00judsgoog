the stem. Thus, the stem of urbe we have seen to be
uro. Then the inflection of mbo is as follows:

a. Gender in Latin does not depend so strictly on
sex as in English. Thus, rubo is feminine, while in
English we call city neuter.

Neuter stems in Latin are inflected somewhat dif-
ferently from stems which are masculine or femi-
nine (39).

b. Stena for convenience, are named according to
the last letter. The last letter cf the stem ano is b.

Now b is a consonant. So uro is a consonant stem.

But among consonants b is a mute (5, IL). So uro
is amute stem.

There are six tenses in Latin-present, imperfect,
future, perfect, pluperiect‚ inture perfect. Their
meaning is about the same as in English.

The Latin “pluperiect'’ is the tense which in English we
sometimes eall the “past perlect.’' ·

The Latin verb also has connected with it certain
forms which have the meaning oi the verb and the
use in a sentence of nouns or adjectives. These are
respectively‚ verbal nouns (the Romans used three
sorts, which they called “ infinitives‚'’ “ gerunds,'' and
“supines'') and participles. We need not pay much
attention to these at present.

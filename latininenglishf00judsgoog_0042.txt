The subject form is called the nominative case, as
in English.

The object form is called iu Latin the accusative
case (instead oi the objective case, as in English).

The other forms are always translated into English
by prepositions, as in the examples.

The forms urbis, os o city, urbium, os cit-tes, are called
the genitive case. A Latin genitive may sometimes be
translated by the English possessive. Thus, urbis may
mean citp's.

The forms urbi, to oc city, urblbtis, to cc'tc'cs, are called
the dative case. A dative may also be translated by
sor. Thus, urbi may mean sor c city.

The forms urbe, totth ocity‚urb1bur,coc'tb cc'ttes, are
called the ablativo case. An ablativo may also be
translated by froca, ta, or by. Thus, urbe may mean '
from a city, or ia a city, or by a city.

An ablativo, like an accusative, may be used as the
object of a Latin proposition. Thus, In urbs means
tn u city.

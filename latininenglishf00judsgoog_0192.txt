Latin eompounds are used in great numbers as Eng-
lish words. They ean be properly explained, however,
only as Latin words. To attempt the analysis of suoh
an English word by resolving it at once into its parts
is merely to put the oart before the horse. Sometimes
students are taught, tor instance, that interruptim eon-
sists 01 the prefix inter, meaning between, the root rap,
to break, and the suffix tion, meaning an aet. In truth,
however, interruptionis merelythe stem of the Latin
noun interruptio. The stem' is a oompound 01 the
preposition inter and the noun stem raphon. The last
is composed of the supine stem rupt (from the verb
stem rap) ÷ the suffix -16n-, whioh denotas the aot
(117,1).

Benefactor is obviously the noun denoting the agent
(117, 2), from beatificae, to do good, as malefactor is
from 101ιό111οέ16, 10110111, and satisfaction from 1111111111·
cere, 10110 enough.

From magnanimus, preat 00111011, we have 1110011001·-
1110110,Ι impugnare, to flpbt apainst, gives us irnpnpn.
The former word is merely the Latin nominative, with
the last syllable adapted 10 our way 01 spelling. We
are not aeoustomed 10 end words in the syllable -as,
—we write 01111001, speciano, tortaons, 0110101111 (136).
Irnpnpn is the nude stem 01 the Latin verb, unohanged.
This nude stem 01 a Latin verb (with or without silent
e final) we find also in the words 01000011, pensante,
11111001, interpone, postpone. Their meaning is found
in the examples (145).

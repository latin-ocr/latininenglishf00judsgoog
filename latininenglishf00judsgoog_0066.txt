39. The noun stems thus far studied are masculine
cr feminine. Neuters are scmevvhat different in their
inflecticn.

It has been seen that masculine and feminine liquid
stems take no ending in the nominative singular. A
neuter stem ending in a consonant we shall find takes
nc case ending either in the nominative or in the
accusative singular. And in those cases in the plural,
neuters take the ending a (or la) instead cf δε.

In the rest of the cases neuter stems take the same
endings as masculine and feminine stems.

Thus the table of endings for neuter consonant
stems is as follows:

Sucorvn Trana er Ernrrvcs.
Plar.
ἆ (or ra)

nm (or mm)

In the inflectiun, final t preceded by a is dropped.

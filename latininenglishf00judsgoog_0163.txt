114. o. A few primary stems are formed by other
changes as well as by suffixos.

Root can, ιο strip, perfect stem cecina This is
formed by prefixing to the root the initial letter with
ὅ (a in the root becoming 1, — as usual after a prefix).
Such a change is called reduplication (86, 1)

. Root dno, ιο leod, present stem duc· (ᾱῖιοό, Ι leod).
To form the stem the root vowel is lengthened.

Root frag, ιο broulo, present stem frang· (frango, I
troald( A nasal is inserted (86, 2).

But the formation of primary stems by suffixes i's
the ordinary way.

b. The suffixos which form secondary stems are
¹ very numerous, and they usually have a meaning ·
quite definite: -ura denotes oa acr‚-sgrrcu1tara‚aqrc
cultura· or denotes the door of an act, -root vio, coo-
qaeo, supine stem vict, noun stem victer- (N. victor, m),
ο corvqrrernr. Victor may thus be regarded as formed
with the secondary suffix -or added to the supine stem
of the verb vinco. Compare above, near end of 113.

The suffixos whether priinary or secondary, will be
explained in the following Studies.

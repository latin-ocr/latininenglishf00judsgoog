The casola (nasus, aeae) are sounded by expelling the
breath through the nose. n in certain positione has the sound
oi ny in English3 ay. ancora, auctor (pronounoed as if spelled
angcora).

The liquide (llquidus, flato) are so called because the breath
rolls so smoothly from the mouth in forming them.

The spirante (spirans, trenching) are made by breathing
sharply against the palate (h); more gently over the tip oi
the tongue through the teeth (s) ; and between the upper teeth
and the lower lip (s). ,

The mutes are so called because in the process oi sounding
them the breath is entirely stopped by olosing the organs of
speech.

The double consonant, x, was frequently used, but was
merely a device oi the scribes to save writing es. It has the
sound oi those two letters (like les in books or a in boa).

z the Romans rarely used (see 4).

A diphthong is a combination of two vowels with
hutone sound. The separate sounds glide together
and unite.

The ones commonly used are ae, oe, eu, en

Oi the two vowels in a diphthong the second, if a palata-l,
must not stand higher in the scale (t, L), te. must not be more
nearly open, than the first; ii the second vowel is a labial‚ it
must be lower in the scale than the first.

From this it will be seen that there can be no diphthong
ending in a. There is also no diphthong ending in ο.

The diphthongs beginning with a (open diphthongs) are ae,
nl, au.

The labial diphthongs crece, ol, ui

The palatal diphthong is eu.

Τ111131113 no royal road 10 learning3 and this book
is by no means intended even as a “ short cut '' 10 3
complete knowledge 01 Latin. But it is the belief 01
the writer that it is possible to get definite valuefrom
knowing some Latin, even 11 one is unable to know
much Latin3 and that it would be a saring of time
and energy 10 have selected for one just the portion
which would huwe the most immediate utility.

There are many studente in our high schools and
academias who do not study Latin 31 all. But with
the most 01 these it is 311 object to get as thorough au
acquaintance 33 may be with the English languagc‚
and for this purpose there 313 made 3 number 01
works on the analysis 01 words. All such books, how·
ever, have virtually 10 ignore the 1301 01 the eom-
posite source 01 English. The mere 3333111011 that 3
given root or suffiri is 01 Latin or Greek origin means
very little 10 the student And 3 knowledge of deriv-

’ 311133 gained in this way 13 usually quite mechanioal

and narrow.
It 13 the theory 01 the present work that the deri- -
ration 01 English words from Latin cannot be well

understood by one who is ignorant 01 that language.

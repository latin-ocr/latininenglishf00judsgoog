Ir one examines the words in an English diotionary,
it will be seen that many oi them are horrowed from
other languages. “Wigwam” is irom an American
Indian dialect. The early settlers in Massaohusetts
had no word of their own to indioate the rude struet
ure in ‚whioh the satages were sheltered, and so tried
to imitate the Indian name. “ Lasso '' is a Spanish
word, learned by the hunters and oowboys from the
Mexioans. “Depot'' we have taken from the Frenoh
as a oonvenient term to denote a plane ior storage.
It is frequently used in the United States as applied
to a railway station, although it is not so appropriate
in that sense as the word “station'' “ Aquilino '' is
from the Latin word “aquila'' which means an eagle3
an aquiline nose is one our-ved like an eagle’s beah.
And so we might easily find words taken from a
variety of other languages‚—German, Turhish‚ Por-
tugueso, Russian, Chinese, Dutoh‚ and many more.

· Other languages borrow foreign wordS, but English
¹ is peculiar in the iant that ithae so many. In faot, a

aries are not English in their origin ‘Authors differ

6) Several words iu the Latin nominative are used
without change as English words: calculus, modulus,
formula, odim, praemium, abdomen, specimen, vinch-
Ιῠω, and others.

A calculus is a pcbhle, and is used in medicine as the
technical name for alittle stone sometimes seoreted in
some parts of the body, for example, in the bladder.
But as pebbles were anciently used in rechoning (just
’ as children and savages even now use their fingers),
calemus came to mean any method of computation,
and so is used now as the name of certain branches
'of mathematica it is from the word iu this sense
that we have the words calculata, calculatione. A vln-
culum is something used to hired, -a houd. The word
is used in algebra of a sign which binds together
several expressions.

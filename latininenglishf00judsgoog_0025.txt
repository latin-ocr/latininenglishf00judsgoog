INTRODUCTION· XV

It will be seen that diction, dorca dcccdccc, indict,
predict, predicate, for instance, have the root dic. One
who is familiar with Latin recognitos dic as the root
of a Latin verb meaning “ to say.'' So it is plain that
all these English words must have some meaning
connected with “ saying.'' And a moment's ¹reflection
will show this to be correct. 'she other syllables in
these words are also Latin, each with a meaning easily
understood by the Latin scholar.

Sursly an intelligent knowledge of the language we
use is a-valuable thing to have. But this largo ele
ment of the language which comes from the Latin
cannot be understood unless one knows something
of that language. How much must one know? Of
course if it is possible to study Latin for years, so as

to know very much about it, it will be so much the
better. But if that cannot be done, it isat least
possible to become familar with Latin modes of inflec-
tion and derivatim, and to learn a number of the more
ordinary Latin words. In this way a flood of light is
pourcd on the meaning of a large part of our English
speech.

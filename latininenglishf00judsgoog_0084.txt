Many adjectives apparently have two stems, one
ending in a consonant and the other in 1. The l stem
is used in the plural, the consonant stem in the numi-
native singular, and either or both in the remaining
cases of the singular. See Study XI.

In the ablativa singular, adjective stems in nc have
i, while participle stems in nt- have ὅ.

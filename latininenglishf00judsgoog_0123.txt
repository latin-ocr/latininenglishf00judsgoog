An examination of these examples will show that
there are three general ways in which the change is
made: (1) By a prefix. (2) By a change in the body
of the verb stem. (3) By a suffix.

1. The only prefix used is the reduplication. This
‚consisto of the initia] consonant followed by 1 or ὅ.
Thus geu· gives gigen- (the ὅ being dropped for con-
venience of enunciation).

2. The change in the body of the stemwmay consist
in the lengthening of avowel. Thus duc gives duo.
It frequently consiste in the insertion of a nasal (m
before a labialy otherwise n). Thus rup, enh, vlo,
frag, fud, yield the present stems rump, cumo, vinc,
frang, fund. Sometimes the stem vowel and the
final consonant change places: sper- beuomes apro.

3. The suffix may be ιι. Thus from tem eomes
temn. The suffiri may be ec„ Thus from 016-
comes cresc. The suffix may be t. Thus pleo-
givcs pleon. The suffix may be a vowel, 'as in the
last four examplcS, caph, sanct, wlde, juva.

The stem gea changes to ger· merely because in the
inflection of the present stem ιι would always corne
between two vowels (38). ’

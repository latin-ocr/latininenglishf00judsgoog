Gordiocl is the name of a red color and of an order
of rank in the Roman Catholic priesthood. Originally
it means something importem, that on which other
things torn (from cardin, linge). Hence it came to
be applied to ahigh rank in ahc priesthood, and then

Latin stem which means linge.

Altitudo, magnitude, and multitude are simply the

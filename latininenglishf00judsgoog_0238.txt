swnY XXXIX—comm WORDS.

149. English words of Latin origin are not merely

, those which consist of a Latin word or the stem of a

Latin word. It is sometimes convenient to express an
idea by joining two Latin sterne which the Romans
never used together. Thus a bicameral legislatore is
one which is composed of two chambers (eq. the con-
gress of the United States consiste of the Senate and
the House of Representatives). Bt is the stem of bls,
twice, and comeret is the nude stem of cameraris, an
adjective formed from the noun stem camere, o
ehomter. But there is no Latin word bicamerills.

Such words are called comen wosns. Many of
these words have an English or a Greek suffix attached
to a Latin stem: eq. dentiat is from the Latin stem
dent, tooth, with the Greek suffix ffidenoting the
one who does something implied in the stem-in
this case, one who attends to the teeth.

Examples of coined words are the following:

adverb, alluvial‚ ambidextrous, antedate, antediln·
wien, binomial, caloric, candal, centennial, centrifugal,
oentripetal, oongenial, codrdinate, coronation, coroner,

articulate one immediately alter the other, or which
have a disagreeable sound. In such cases one of
three things is usually done: (1) one of the sounds
is omitted3 or (2) one is changed3 or (3) both are
changed.

In the word allude the prefix is od. But adludo would be
awkward to pronounce. So we say allude - changing d to l.

¹ These changes are called phonetic (te. seond) changes,
and in writing and printing are indicated by a change
of letters. ’

The usual purpose of phonetic changes, as explained above,
is to secure ease oi uttcrance. Usage has determined that
within certain limite such changes are convenient and useful.
But in many cases people make phonetic changes, especially
the omission of sounds, from mere carelessness and lazincss:
ay. “ goin' ’‘ ior “ going.” These who wish to speak pure and
elegant English are on their guard against an articulation so
elorenly.

10. (1) There are many ways of making phonetic
change-more in Latin than in English. These will
be explained from time to time as they become neces·
sary in use.

(2) But besides the changes that result from the
collision of sounds (9), the Romans often made pho
netic changes in the final syllable of a word to which
nc suffia was attached: cp. the stem (18 a) nomin,
used as a word without a suffia, became nomen, acore
(from the stem we have the English words aomiaol,
maluere, etc).

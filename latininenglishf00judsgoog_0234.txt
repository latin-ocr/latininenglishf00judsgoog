In the above list we notice examples of all the
forms of derivation from Latin nude stems as soen in
Study XXXVII.

There are consonant stems of nouns, like cessation,
cession, oration3 vowel stema of nouns (nude)—a
stemS, like stature, from statura-1 stema, like ultor,
from alfifi--o stems, like proverb, from proverbio

(N. proverbium), the nude nominative of stcms in -1n-
(37), like multitude, from multitudo (stem multitud1n-);
adjective nude stems iu o, like buton, from baniguo
(N. banigntrs) ;,-prescnt stems of verbs (with or with-
out final e), like heliae, from declinare, to baud uscue

turb ; supine stema of verbs, like effect from efficere
(effectus); present participle stema, like repom, from

147. There are other words which come from the
Frenoh, which in that language have made a change
from the Latin stem, but which yet are easily recog-
nizahle.

Amovous is from the nude stem of morosus, full os
loce (from amtr, love). The modern French form of
this sternis omoreuc, -eu standing for the Latin ὃ.
We write ou for the French au (which in the older
French was ou or u).

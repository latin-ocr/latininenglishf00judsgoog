Of course, muoh knowledge would he desirable3 but
in faot, as has been said, for a large proportion oi our
high school students that is out of the question. Is
it, then, possible to get so muoh acquaintance with
Latin etymology, with the peouliar methods oi infleo-
tion and of the composition of words in that tongue‚
and to aequire suoh a voeabulary, as to make the Latin
derivation of. English words intelligible‚ and at the
same time not to spond more than an ordinary school
year in the process? This hook is an attempt to
answer that question in the affirmative.

There is a further purpose. The deoision that a hoy
or girl shall or shall not study Latin is often made at
an early age and without very mature consideration3
and not infrequently when too late the student regrets
anegdtive deoision. By taking up this work it is possi·
ble to spond a year in studying the English language,
and at the same time to get suoh a start in Latin that
ii then desired it will be easy to go on. Thus the
important deoision in question may he deferred a year,
and finally made more intelligently.

These two purposes the author has attempted to
carry out, -with what suooess oan only be seen when
the book has had the test of the schoolroom.

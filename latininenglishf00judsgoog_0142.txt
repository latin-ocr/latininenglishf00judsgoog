116 vnn chrm m momen. [ee

The present imperative follows the same principles as the
present indicative-using no connecting vowel except before a
nasei, and dropping the radica] ὅ when a connecting vowel is
used. The forms are:

ὄε crs-te
ers-to estote
esto estu-nto

The ending of the present infinitive is ῐέ. After the stem
de, r of this ending is assimilated. Hence the form ers-ee.

In the imperfect indicative the connecting vowel a was used.
That brought s of the stem between two vowels‚ causing the
change to r (89). Hence the forms:

era-m §ra-mite
era-s era-tie
erit-t ere-nt

In the imperfect subjunctive the characteristic is -re·‚ pre-
fixed to the personal endings. This r is then assimilated to the
preceding s oi the stem.

essem cese-mus
cese-s es-se-tie
esse-t esse-nt

In the future indicative the same connecting vowels are used
’ which afterwards were given to the present indicative (46). Of
course the radical vowel was retained throughout, sbecoming r
between two vowels.

§rb er-i-miis
dri-s Er-i-tls
eri-t eru-nt

The perfect and supine stems are from a totally different
verb stem, ln. The tenses formed from them are inflected
like those of other verbs.

in the middle ages the Latin t came to have the
sound ts, and after a while the t, being diffioult to

sound before s, was dropped out. This left merely '

the s sound, whioh the Frenoh spelled oe. The i was
lost, the nude stem being taken to end in -nt-. We
have many words in oe taken thus from the Erenoh
way of spelling, although the words are often direotly
from Latin. Sopianae, from the Latin sapientia, wie
dom, and somnoleace, from the Latin somnolentia,
oleepioem, oame through the Erenoh, like benevoleooe.
So does palare, from palidum, in the same way.

Debt is a word witha silent letter, b. It was onos
written in English detto, pronounoed just as we do
debt. It was taken into English from the old Freuoh
word detto, which in turn was the oareless Frenoh way
of sounding the stem of the Latin debita, o sam owed.
After English people remembered the origin of the
Frenoh word, they eame to slip in a b, to show their
learning, and so we now write dedi, although we never
sormd the b. We have taken debit, however, direotly
from the Latin nude stein.

Other Frenoh ohanges in Latin stems are seen in
these English words: daga from dignari, to thiale

worthy, or proper ,· mountain, from montana (a late “

Latin form for mont, N. mons); saint, from sanetus,
hely.

The Latin verb facere, to make, had another stem
used in the passive, ft. From this the Frenoh formed
a number of wordS, and we have followed their iashion
—sometimes adopting these Erenoh words, sometimes
taking Latin ones, but always writing -fy instead of si.

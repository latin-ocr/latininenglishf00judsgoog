Articulate souuds are made by a current oi air (the brenth)
which passes from the lnugs through the vocal corda aud is
modified by the palate, tongue‚ teeth‚ aud lips.

a is called the epea vowel, because in souuding it the J'aws
aud lips are wide open. lt will be seen that e is then sounded
by partially closing the jaws‚ andi by more nearly closing
them; ο by partially closing the lips, and ιι by almost closing
them. Hence l and ιι ιιι called close vowels, aud e and ο
mediol vowels. y has the sound oi l, with the lips held in
position to sound u, -like u in French or ii in German.

Again, iu souuding a, e, l, the breath is thrown against
successive parts oi the palate. Hence these vowels are called
pelasci. Iu sounding ο and ιι the breath is thrown out directly
through the lips. Hence these vowels are called lobicl (irom
the Latin labium, lip).

By continuiug the successive contractiori oi the vocal organa,
the consonatis are iormed in the order oi the table until the
surd mutes are reached.

Iu sounding the consonante the breath is modffied, as has
been said, by one or more oi the parts oi the mouth. Those
that result irom throwing the breath against the palate are
called palescis. Those iu making which the tongue is espe-
cially active are called lingnula (lingua, longae). Those whose
souud is formed by the use oi either (or both) oi the lips are
called labiola (labium, lip).

The sonent consonants (sonam, scandice) are made by
expelling the breath iorcibly.

In the surda (surdus, cutheard) the breath is emitted
quietly.

The semicowela j (τι in English) and v (= w iu English),
ιιι merely the vowels l and ιι used to begin a syllable; ag.
ejus, veul. Thus the close vowels can hardly be distinguished
from the most open consonante. Indeed, in many Latin texts
the iorms j and v never occur, l and ιι being always written.

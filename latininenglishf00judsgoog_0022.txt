’ἱ very widely in 1110 proportior 01 horrowed words ἵ
’ which they use3 but all English writers employ a

considerable number,—sometimes 00 many as two ⁶

thirds.

About four-fifths 01 011 the horrowed words in our

language we find come 110111 the Latin, either direotly
or through the French. The Frenoh language, indeed,

At the beginning 01 the Christian era Rome was

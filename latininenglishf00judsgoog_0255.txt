lt isdifficult to asoertain the reason wh the Lives oi Suetonius have
been suffered to remain solong unedited gy English-speaking scholars.
No workoi equal sine that has come down to us from classical antiquity
possessos amore real interest or a more enduringvalue. ln the his-
torical significance of the period that it covers, in· the light it throws

been regarded as a most important source oi information concerning
the men and measures of the Early Empire. lt is also a rich mine oi
personal anecdote, 'ving innumerable glimpses of many famous Ro-
mans, divested oi title stage properties with which we almost always
find them in the pages oi the professional historians.

lt is, then, with the hope oi gaining for the Roman Plutarch awider
circle oi appreciative readers that the present volume is given to the
public. The first twobooks oi the Lives have been selected because they
have to do with that riod oi transition which, with its tremendous
moral, social, and political revolution, forms perhaps the most remark·
able era of Roman histo ς and also because their subject is the per·
sonality oi the two great sars who laid the foundation oi an empire
whose influence is still moulding the development of modern Europe,

as its grandeur is still potent in the realm o imagination.

The tert oi dressresent editionis based upon the text oi C. L. Roth

(Leipzig, 1886). me variations from his readings have been noted
and defended in the Commentary. To obviate any reasonable ob·
iections to Suetonius's plainness of speech, a few sentences have been
relegated to the notes, but without any alteration in the original num·
bering oi the sections. These textual omissions have been made with
tamtlillalllthltstpltulhttihrzhlrtltlthtu:
tended system oi expurgation is at once a moral blunder and a literary
crime.

with special relerence to the etymology ol English words ol
Greek origin. By T. D. Goonnu, Ph.D. tomo.

This book attempts to teach that limited portion oi Greek which col-
lege men remember after they have iorgotten vastly more. That is the
portion which even those who wish to banish the study oi Greek from
our schools would admit can least easily be spared, and that portion is
essential to a read command oi the English tongue.

The first idea οἶ the book arose from hearing a woman oi unusual in·
telligence and considerable reading, talking about altruists, when she
meant agnostics. Similar confusions—coniusing‚ ultimately, to the
speaker, and constantly to the listener-areoi not mirequent occurrence
iu conversation on topicsinterestingonlyto the“educated.” Moreover‚
much as the Greek element oi English appears in conversation, it ap-
pears much more in literature, aud carries many oi the key·words to the
thought. He to whom these key-words are not alive with meaning is at
great disadvantage. Many a man who thinks he has retained nothing “
whatever from lus Greek, except a lively sense oi the exact meaning ol
such words as metaphystcs, agnostic, synthetic, anarchy, Russophobe,
nevertheless regards that sense as an intellectual acquisition worth all it
cost. But alter all, how great the cost oi this one acquisitiou has been i
Surely this one result oi the study oi Greek can be reached without de·
voting to it years oi time. And yet mere dictionaries or etymologioal
haudbooks alone cannot give what is wanted. lt is not enough to read
or be told, even repeatedly, that synthetic is derived irom such and
such Greek words, and therefore has such aud such a meaning. The
words in their Greek surm, and with some fra t of theti· Greek
assocebtions, must become somewhat familiar be ore onecanbe seusible
oi that grasp oi their English derivatives which will enable one to use
those derivatives correctly and learlessl .

The Greek vombulary surviving in Eynglish can be so presented in a
sort oi Greek primer, with its relations to English so pointed out, that
even young pupils will find the study iar from dull; aud thus, oi just
that part of Greek which they will always use in reading current litera·
ture, they will be apt to remember more than the much-abused
“average college graduale.'’

This book tries to accomplr'sh these results without waste oi time and
hrain-tissuein “mental discipline” of doubtful value. But the writer has
no laith in royal roads to learning, does not profess to have compounded
an educational nostrum which wrll, in a few weeks’ time, electnfy a boy
or girl into the masteryoi a difficult tongue, and does believe heartily in ⁴
givrng an important place in our educational system, ior some genera·
tiens yet, to the patient and thorough study oi the Greek language and
literature. This book is not intended to lessen the number of those
who shall enter upon such a course oi study, but it is hoped that it may
increase that number. Yet it is not a sufficient introduction to the
reading oi a classic author, and hence is not a rival oi the various ex·
cellent “ First Lessons” in use. ln putting these ideas into practice the
material has been grouped about a grammatica] outline, because the
thorough memorizing ol a few inflections will save time and labor in
the end, by enabling the pupil from the outset to makeacertain limited
use oi the language on rational principles. ln no other waycan the re·

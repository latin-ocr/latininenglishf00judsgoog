Clamoso, ooloar, honour, laborer, arethe mode of spelling
the words in England‚ the ou in the last syllable showing
that they come irom the Freneh and not direotly ironr the
Latin. In this country, however, we have formed the habit oi
writing elamor, color, horror, labor. It certainly is hardly
worth while to keep the a, which is entirely useless otherwise,
merely to point out the historieal fact that suoh words were
originally taken into English from the Freneh. Ii we are to
try to show by spelling the history oi words rather than merely
their sonoris, our spelling will steadily grew eren more tangled
and ridieulous than it is.

Fooetioas is from the Frenoh forotieoo, and that
from the Latin tacitus, wittp. Here the nominative
form was taken into Frenoh, e being written fore
(having the same sound) as in omoreoe, and eo for
the vowel. The o' before eu seems to oome from a oon-
iueion with the Latin noun facetiae, y'olcea In taking
the Freneh word, we write oa for eo, and a ior a.

We have taken many Latin adjectivae direotly into English
from the nominative in -us (136), writing ooo for -us, It seems
likely that this was in imitation oi the hanah ehange, as ex-
plained above.

Another change from the Latin stem whioh results
from our borrowing aword from the Freneh, is seen
in heoeooleooe. The Frenoh form is the same, the
Latin being benevolentia. As has been explained,

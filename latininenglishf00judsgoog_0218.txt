and hence 010 which would quite often be heard, is
preferred in English. But it seems frequently to have
been treated as if it were 110011 001011, the nude form
being used, with silent c final, if the preceding vowel
. is long. Examples are fortitude, altitude, and others3
see 134. The stem becomes 01 English word in mar-

gin (margin).

l. lt will be noticed that the inflection oi siim differs in
some particulare from that oi other verbs. Thai is doubtless
for the reason that siim is rnuch more ancient than other verbs,
and keeps the very old forms oi inflection.

In these old forms, the only connecting vowel in the present
indicative was n, used before a nasal (m, n).

The present stem is ὄε- (compare the English is). In the
present tense the redical vowel ὅ was dropped whenever a
connecting vowel was used. Hence the indicative formsare
readily explained:

eii-m eil-mii·
de οι- tls
οι· t eu-nt

In the present subjunctive the old connecting vowel was l.
Hence the iorms ol siim are (the radical vowel dropped, as

above) ἶ sdan sti-mne

erl-n e-i-tis
vlt el-nt

and snm. Wherever the radical vowel ol ὄε- is dropped, the
toi pot· is assimilated to the following s. Hence the iuflection
is, in the present indicative, possum, petes, petest, possit-
mus, potestis, possunt. The present subiunctive is possim,
possm, etc. The other tenses, poteram, petere, in the indic-
ative, have no change. The imperfect subjunctive possem,
and the present infinitiva posse, show the assiniilation of t to s.

In the tenses formed from the perfect stem, lin in- disap
pears alter t: petua, potueram, etc.

3. ierit, I bccr, stem ier, is another verb which shows traces
oi the old form oi inflection without a connecting vowel before
r, ε, t. In ¹the present indicative the first person uses the same
vowels as other consonant sterns, Thus the inflectlon oi that
tense in the active is lero, ier-e, ier-t, ierimus, tertis, lerunt ;
in the passive, letor, ier-ris, ier-thr, terimur, ferimini, le·
rantur. The imperative active is: present, let, ier-te ; future,
ier-te, ier-te, ier-tbte, lenmtb. And the passive: present,
ier-re, ldrlmlnn future, ier-tdr, ier-tor, ier-untdr. The pres-
ent imperative active is lene, and the passive ier-ri.

Like sitm, iero uses a stem irorn an entirely distinct root as
aperlect stem -tn1-. The perfect is tali, etc.

The supine stem is from a third root-litt. In point of
fact these three stems happen to have the same meaning, and
so are joined in inflection. The principal parts are ίόῐό, terre,

tint, latiis. Several verbs form the principal parts in this way ’

from different roots. For convenience we call these the parts
of one and the same verb. Oi course lerd, tuli latiis, are
really quite different words, rather than different forms oi the
same word (as is the case with carpo, carpsi, carptus).

' 4. volo, Iam willico, and its compounds nblb and mile,
also retain traces of the older form ol inflection.

The stem oi volo lavdi, the radical vowel also appearing
aseendit.

In the present indicative the inflection is vole, vis, vult,
volumus, vultis, volunt. The radical vowel is wealrened to
· u when the connecting vowel is omitted, though in older Latin

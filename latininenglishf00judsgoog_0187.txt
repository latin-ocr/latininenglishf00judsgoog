English. words are made from Latin verb stems in
various ways.

1. Sometimes the verb stem (nude) or the present
stem (nude) is used without change (145, 2); corp,
from carpere, ιο nibble, ιο pluch; domo, from clamare,
ιο condamm cede, from cedere, ιο yield (here the silent
eis added).

2. We recognize not a few English words which
are Latin present participle sterne (145, 3); agent,
from agere, ιο (ιο, amicat, from radiare, ιο 050οι
noya· crescent, from crescere, ιο prow. The meaning
of these words is plain, An open-t is one who does
something, sometimes acting for another person. We
call a person's iace rudiunt when it seems to shine
with joy. And the moon is mercati when it is new
(ιο. when it is just growing larger).

3. The supine stems of verbs we find in a large
number oi English words (145, 1). The student will
see the meaning oi the following words, in which
appear supine stems of verbs cited in Study XXXI.:
irtoorttolion, turpiore, oct, recreet, capture, 013100,οοιο
tion, locutios, ιοοοιο, cornicata, oration, epirotica.

There are swanus oi English words in nte and otico which
corne from Latin supine stema. These will be given in Part IV.

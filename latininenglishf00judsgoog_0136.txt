We could not get this from the indicative alone. carpo “
might have a stem carp- or carpe, statuo might have
statii- or statua, hmo might have ilm- or limet. And one
could not tell from the forms cllpid or audio alone which has
the stem in l and which in 1. The inlinitlve at once shows
which itis.

The infinitive alone would not always help one. carpere
might be from a stem carpi- and capere from a stein cap.
llere the indicative settles the question.

In order to inflect a Latin verb, it is obvious that one needs
to know the three stems. As has just heen explained, the
present indicative and the present infinitive together will give
the present stem. The perfect indicative active will always
give the perfect stem. And the perfect participle will always

give the supine stem.
These tour forms are called the numerent rrnrs of a Latin

verb. Hereafter they will be given, the student being left to

find the stems from them.
The verh stem, from which the three inflective stems are

formed, may usually be seen quite readily if one has the latter.

94. The gerundis averbal noun, translated by the
English verbal (or participial) noun in -t'nyz carpen·
ditm, pluckiny.

The stem of the gerundis formed by attaching the
ending -endo- to the present stem of the verb.

The stem is inflected only in the singular number, and is
never found in the nominative.

The connecting vowel ὄ of this ending is absorbed by the
stem vowel ὄ or ἄ of the present stein.

2. Quantity.

14. The quantity of a syllable is the relative time
taken in pronouncing it.

Syllables are either loay or ebori. A long syllable
takes longer time to pronounce than does a short one.

A long vowel is supposed to take about twice aa long to
prouounce as does a short one. The relative length oi syllables
must be less exact, as there is no uniformity in the number oi
articulations they may contain. The more letters in a syllable,
the longer it will take to sound it (there are no silent letters in
Latin, ia).

Stin, one long syllable is considered about equal to two short
ones

15. The quantity of a syllable depende either on the
quantity of its vowel or on the character of the letters
following its vowel. The first of these¹ two is called
actura quantity3 the second, quantity by position.

A syllable is long by naioreif it contains either a
diphthong or a long vowe13 eq. the first syllable of
aru-rum, fre-gi.

A syllable is short by actare if it contains a short
vowel; aq. the first syllable of ca-do.

A syllable is long by positionis its vowel is followed ἡ

by two consonante (except a mute and a liquid), or a
double consonaut; eq. the first syllables of ati-do, dux.
But in pdtrls, a is short.

A syllable is short by position if its vowel is imme·
diately followed by another vowel; aq. the first sylla
ble of vri-a.

In determining quantity, h is not considered at all ; ap. in
tra-ho, the first syllable is short by position.

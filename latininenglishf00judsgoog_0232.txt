11 was commonly used hythe Frenoh with whom the
English were familiar-and that afterwards it appeared
in English books. It is merely a matter 01 history.

01 course this historioal questiones to any given
word 01 this olass makes no difference with regard to
its meaning, or its spelling, or the Latin stem 110111
whioh it 0011100. 1)101101101100 do not always head the
question. For example, Webster's International Die-
tionary, under cnssrorv, says: “ L. 000010, fr. eadere
to give way3 01. F. oession.’' This shows the Latin
origin (although the dictionary 1111101111110101)1 gives
merely the Latin nominative instead 01 the stem), and
points out (“ef.'' is 101 the Latin confer, compare) the
Frenoh 101111. But it gives no notion whether the
English word came direotly from the Latin, or direotly
from the Frenoh. It is plain enough that the Frenoh
word must have 001110 from the Latin. But 111110
word is examined in an etymologioal dictionary, like
Skeat's, it will be explained quite differently. It will
there appear that aesalon is 110111 the Frenoh 0000100,
and the latter is from the Latin aesalon-,which is 110111
the partioipial stem cessus, 01 cedere, 10 010101.

However, it is not absolutely necessary that the
student at this point should in all oases know 1110
111010110οΙ 1001 as to the Frenoh origin 01 words which

are obviously 111010 Latin stems. The important thing

is to understand the Latin origin.

A few examples 01 these words follow, with the
Latin original, the Frenoh word which was direotly
borrowed being omitted. 011011 this Freneh word did
not differ in 101111 from the English.

and his nobles, and the principal ohurch officers, in

short all the ruling class, were Normans. Now the
Normans were Erench, and they continued to speak
French long after their settlement in England. But
after three or four centurias the two nations, Normans
and English, became quite thoroughly mingled, and
the Erench language gradually oeased to be used.

The English which took its place, however, naturally
contained a very large number of Erenoh words. It
must be remembered that the Normans formed the
wealthy and ruling class, while the old English, the
Saxone, were the middle class and the peasants. So

we might expect to find French words used for such Ἴ l

ideas as would be common in the great castle, while
the peasant would still keep to his blunt AngloSaxon.
ς Thus “ox’' was the homely name given the animal
ἢ by the Saxon herdsmen. But when the ox was slaugh-
tered and carried to the castle to be caten, it was called
by the Norman name of “ beef.''

But, as has been said, the Erenoh language used by
· the Normans was only a formos Latin. And so there
came into English a large number of Latin words
through the Norman Erenoh. And about the same
number have been taken direotly from Latin.

So it is that while thebaeis of English is a German
dialect, not very different from what we call Low
Dutch, still, more than hali its words came from the
Latin language. χ

Now these Latin words are usually rather long ones.
They generally consist of some simple part, called
the root, and a variety oi syllables prefixed or added.

Besides those in the list (123), there are some prep
¹ositions which are used only as prefixes: ambr, amb,
ororind,· (110, (11, acaadcr, 00011, In, 001 ( -- the English
cin->5 por, 10000001, re, red, 00010, εδ, sed, aeide, opcrl;
ve, 001.

Not infrequently 0 verb with 0 prefix shows a
change of its radice] vowel: teneo, Ι hold, contineo, I
hold together. Here the short e becomes 0110111 The
same change is often made with short a: habeo, Ι daca·
adhibeo, I hooc to myreis, 10. Ι cclcc, or adopt. The
diphthong ae, in like manner, becomes i: caedo, Ι
cua· incido, Icut into. The diphthong au becomes fi:
claudo, I close ; inclv‘ido, I close into, I include. '

111. Let us look at another set of nouns: respublica,
repedita· agricultore, conculcare ,· ign106161,firecolored;
and the adjective magnentium, preat scaled.

We see 01 once that each of these consiste of two
separate words joined together, neither being a mere

preposition. Respublroa = the noun res, thing, 1- the .

adjective publica, public ,² agricultore = the noun stem
agro- (ὄ changed to 1), field, -{- the noun cultore, ccc
tiodrico, ignicolor = the noun stem igni, fise, 1- the
noun color, color,· magnanimos = the adjective stem
magno, procl, -Ι- 11ιο noun animas, soal.

We notice also: (1) That the first part is usually a
stem (11 would be in respublica, except that that word
is often written as two-res publice), (2) that the
stem vowel before a consonant appears as 1 (agri, in-
stead of egro-g (3) that the stem vowel before another
’ vowel is dropped (magn- instead of magno).
